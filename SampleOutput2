Testing Highlight Doc with Query 1

doc: Service here was great. We had a fabulous and friendly waiter. We
tried the Classic, Mediterranean Chicken, Vegetable, and Little Star deep
dish pizzas. The Little Star was the best followed by the Classic. The pizza
was good but I honestly preferred the BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza I had
at Patxi's in Hayes Valley. However the atmosphere and service at Little
Star's was much better. Also the ice cream from the local creamery in the
Mission (I wish we had heard which one it was) was delicious.

doc: I must say, I was never a fan of the thick or deep dish
pizzas...HOWEVER, after my sister took me to Little Star, I changed my
mind completely. I LOVE, absolutely LOVE their deep dish pizzas. I tried
all the vegetable deep dish specialties (my sister is a vegetarian) and I was
amazed! The crust is so flaky and is juicy in its buttery goodness and I
REALLY RECOMMEND this place for all you pizza lovers as well as
hesitant deep dish pizza eaters out there. lesson learned: DON'T HATE IT
UNTIL YOU TRY IT! =) Note: The cheesecake is delicious too!

doc: Yup, this beats Zachary's. I was quite doubtful and thought it would be
overrated, but it is indeed wonderful. I bought take-out, but definitely want
to eat in the restaurant some time. The ambience is super nice, kinda
romantic and dimly lit. I ordered the "little star pizza" and split it with my
friend for $20. Here's how it differs from Zachary's. 1) The crust here is
more like pizza crust, less like flaky pie crust. It tastes better. 2) Zachary's
pizzas are very tomato-heavy, which is great if you love tomato, but I prefer
to have more other toppings on my pizza. Little Star puts a LOT of toppings
but still gives that right amount of tomatoes for a deep dish pizza.

doc: I was at my aunt's place which was a few blocks away so my dad and
I decided to walk here for dinner on a Friday night. I didn't see a whole lot
of parking on the street so that could be an issue for anybody not walking.
It took a couple of minutes before anybody noticed us at the door. There
were a lot of people here and at the bar. The lighting gradually got darker
was we approached the back where our table was. There were candles at
each table so at least there was some kind of lighting to read the menu.
Our waiter told us a 9 inch pizza would be enough for two people and if it
were two hungry people, then an appetizer would be enough in addition to
the 9 inch deep dish pizza. We ordered two Blue Paddle Pilsner ($4.75
each), the Spicy Chicken Wings ($11), and a 9 inch pizza that had half with
the Mediterranean Chicken ($19.75 for 9 inch and $25.50 for 12 inch) and
the other half with the Classic ($19.50 for 9 inch and $25 for 12 inch). We
felt that should be enough for both of us. The Spicy Chicken Wings came
out first and there were 10 pieces. It was pretty tasty and good. I didn't
think it was spicy, but it was pretty hot temperature-wise. I nearly burned
my fingers trying to hold it, but I also don't have callus on my fingertips
since I haven't played guitar for a long time. The pizza came later (maybe
30 minutes after we ordered) and it looked like one topping for the whole
pizza but it wasn't. The side with the Mediterranean Chicken was good as
well as the side with the Classic. When the pizza was hot, then it tasted
good; however, as it got cooler, the pizza's taste went
down as well. The Blue Paddle Pilsner was not bad and I wouldn't have
known what else to order since the selection on tap was limited to beer I've
never drank before. Overall, pretty good food and I would recommend
trying their deep dish pizzas.

doc: There's something profoundly special about a pizza you have to eat
with a knife and fork. I've had a few of these Chicago deep-dish types now,
from different places, several times each, and Little Star is just the best. I
almost always get the small Little Star with artichoke hearts as an add-on.
Lemme tell you bout this pizza. Usually I think tomato sauce completely
take-it-or-leave-it, but this one really tastes like crushed tomatoes and is
never too acidic. The spinach is fresh, the mushrooms savory, the top layer
of ricotta is pleasantly creamy while the bottom layer of mozzarella is
satisfyingly stretchy. I love that the artichoke hearts they use aren't over-
marinated and tangy, and preserve the real flavor of the vegetable. And the
crust. I always save it for last, savoring it like a dessert. This rich cornmeal
crust is perfectly crispy like a cornbread muffin top. Eating it is like visiting
the southern grandmother I don't have, going back to some roots that
aren't mine, but still being enveloped in the warm embrace of home
cooking. If it seems like I don't want my crusts, you are wrong. I want those
to be the last flavor I enjoy so I can feel that sheer happiness as long as
possible.

doc: I dream about the day I am united with Little Star Pizza once again. If I
were Superman, Little Star Pizza would be my kryptonite. I would live out
my last days in the Fortress of Solitude happily munching on their deep
dish pizza and guzzling some beer and that would be my life. Luckily, I live
across the coast so my road to obesity has been side tracked...for now. I
could wax poetic all day about their thick buttery crust, robust and zesty
tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and Italian sausage. A few tips: + The
deep dish will fill you up pretty quickly! + Come early, the place can fill up
quick! + Wear a cave hat with a light attached to it, the atmosphere is
pretty dark. + Don't plan on going out afterwards.. A siesta should be the
only thing listed in your social agenda after eating here! Ugh, I've done it
again. I've made myself hungry writing a RelevantSnippet review. Now to

Uno" brand pizza...
